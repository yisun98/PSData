## Process
We use MATLAB and ENVI5.3 to handle raw data. If you want to get the raw data, please turn to the references. Also we provide some tools (eg. remove the border, cut into the patch, split data) to make the training data and the test data. Later we will update the tools about zoom details, plot and save figures. See tools/tools.py for details.
